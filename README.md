# Binary Trees Project

## GENERAL

The project is about the binary trees Concept in computer science.

## GENERAL QUESTIONS :

- What is a binary tree ?
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


## Binary Trees

A binary tree is a data structure where each node has at most two children.

## Difference Between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree

The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree lies in the ordering property of nodes.

## Time Complexity Gain Compared to Linked Lists and binary Tree Properties

Compared to linked lists, binary trees can offer gains in time complexity for certain operations; the depth is the maximum level of nodes, the height is the maximum distance from the root to a leaf, and the size is the total number of nodes in a binary tree

## Traversal Methods

There are several methods to traverse a binary tree:

- **In-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, and then traverse the right subtree. In a binary search tree, this traversal visits nodes in ascending order.
- **Pre-order Traversal:** Visit the root node, then traverse the left subtree, and finally traverse the right subtree.
- **Post-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, then traverse the right subtree, and finally visit the root node.
- **Level-order Traversal:** Visit nodes level by level, starting from the root and moving to the next level before visiting child nodes.

These traversal methods serve different purposes and can be used depending on the specific requirements of the problem being solved or the data manipulation needed.

## Types of Binary Trees

- **Complete Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all levels are completely filled, except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- **Full Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- **Perfect Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differs by at most one.
